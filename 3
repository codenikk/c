What is a WAN?

WAN (Wide Area Network) is a network that connects multiple LANs (Local Area Networks) over a large geographical area — such as a city, country, or even worldwide.

Example: The Internet is the largest WAN.

It allows computers and networks in different locations to communicate.

2. How is WAN different from LAN?

Feature	LAN (Local Area Network)	WAN (Wide Area Network)

Coverage Area	Small area (office, school, home)	Large area (city, country, world)
Speed	High (up to Gbps)	Lower compared to LAN
Ownership	Usually owned by one organization	Can be public or privately managed
Devices Used	Switches, hubs	Routers, leased lines
Cost	Low setup cost	High setup and maintenance cost

3. What devices are used to connect two LANs?

To connect two or more LANs together, we use Routers or Layer 3 Switches.

The router forwards data between networks using IP addresses.

WAN links (like leased lines, DSL, or fiber) can connect routers at different LAN sites.

4. What is the purpose of a router in WAN?

A router connects multiple LANs and directs data packets between them across a WAN.
Functions:

Determines the best path for data transfer.

Routes packets between networks.

Performs NAT (Network Address Translation) and firewall functions.

5. What is SSID?

SSID (Service Set Identifier) is the name of a wireless network.

It helps users identify and connect to the correct Wi-Fi network.

Example: If you see “CollegeWiFi” in your phone, that’s the SSID.

6. How do you configure a wireless LAN in Packet Tracer?

Steps:

1. Place Wireless Router and PCs/Laptops on the workspace.


2. Connect wireless devices to the router (automatically connects via Wi-Fi).


3. Click on the Wireless Router → GUI tab → Setup.


4. Enter Network Name (SSID) and Password.


5. Assign IP addresses to the devices (manually or via DHCP).


6. Test connection using the PING command.

7. What protocol is used for wireless communication?

The main protocol family used is IEEE 802.11, which defines Wi-Fi standards such as:

802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac
These manage how devices communicate over wireless signals.



---

8. How can you check connectivity between two LANs?

Use the PING command:

Syntax: ping <destination IP>

If replies are received → the two LANs are successfully connected through the WAN (router).

If not → check routing configuration or IP settings.

9. What is a packet in networking?

A packet is a small unit of data transmitted over a network.
Each packet contains:

Header (source/destination address, protocol info)

Payload (actual data)

Trailer (error checking information)



---

10. What does the Packet Tracer simulation show during transfer?

In Simulation Mode, Packet Tracer visually shows:

Packets moving between devices (colored envelopes).

Encapsulation and decapsulation at each layer (OSI model).

Protocol details (like IP, ICMP, ARP).

Successful or failed delivery of packets.
