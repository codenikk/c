What is SSL?

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a security protocol that provides encrypted communication between a web browser and a web server.
It ensures that data sent over the Internet is protected from eavesdropping and tampering.

🎯 2. What is the purpose of SSL in communication?

The main purposes of SSL are:

Encryption: Protects data from being read by unauthorized parties.

Authentication: Confirms that the website is genuine (not a fake one).

Data Integrity: Ensures data isn’t modified during transmission.

🔄 3. What is TLS?

TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the updated and more secure version of SSL.
It fixes vulnerabilities found in SSL and is the standard protocol used today for secure communication.

> ✅ Note: Modern browsers actually use TLS, but people still say “SSL” out of habit.

🧾 4. How do you recognize SSL packets in Wireshark?

In Wireshark, SSL/TLS packets can be identified by:

The protocol column showing “TLS” or “SSL”

The port number 443 (commonly used for HTTPS)

Packet details showing “Client Hello”, “Server Hello”, “Certificate”, etc. — these are part of the SSL/TLS handshake.



---

🌐 5. What port is used for HTTPS?

HTTPS (HTTP Secure) uses port 443.

HTTP (non-secure) uses port 80.



---

🤝 6. What happens during the SSL handshake?

The SSL handshake is the process where the client and server establish a secure connection.
Steps:

1. Client Hello: The browser sends supported encryption methods.


2. Server Hello: The server chooses encryption and sends its digital certificate.


3. Key Exchange: A session key is securely created.


4. Encryption Begins: All further communication is encrypted with this key.

🔏 7. What is encryption?

Encryption is the process of converting plain text into a coded format (cipher text) using a key.
Only someone with the correct decryption key can read the original data.

💳 8. Why is SSL important for online banking or e-commerce?

SSL is critical because it:

Protects sensitive data like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal info.

Prevents hackers from intercepting or altering data.

Builds trust by ensuring the website is legitimate and secure.

🧠 9. What are digital certificates?

A digital certificate is an electronic document issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that verifies a website’s identity.
It contains:

Website’s public key

Owner information

The CA’s digital signature
This helps users confirm they’re communicating with the real website.

✅ 10. How do you identify a secure website?

You can recognize a secure website by:

URL starting with “https://” (not just “http://”)

A padlock icon 🔒 in the browser address bar

Viewing the SSL certificate details (click the padlock to see the certificate and issuer)
