What is DHCP?

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network management protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters (like subnet mask, gateway, DNS server) to devices on a network.
This eliminates the need for manually assigning IP addresses to each device.

2. What is the function of a DHCP server?

A DHCP server automatically provides:

IP Address to clients

Subnet Mask

Default Gateway

DNS Server Address
It ensures that each device receives a unique IP address and manages IP address allocation efficiently.

3. What are the advantages of DHCP?

✅ Automatic IP assignment – Reduces manual configuration errors
✅ Prevents IP conflicts – Ensures unique IPs
✅ Easy management – Useful in large networks
✅ Centralized control – Configuration changes made once on the server apply to all clients
✅ Efficient reuse of IPs – IPs are released and reassigned when devices disconnect/reconnect

4. What is the difference between static and dynamic IP assignment?

Feature	Static IP	Dynamic IP

Assignment	Manually configured	Automatically assigned by DHCP
Changeability	Fixed	Can change after lease expires
Configuration effort	High	Low
Usage	Servers, printers	PCs, phones, general clients

5. What is a DHCP lease?

A DHCP lease is the time period for which an IP address is assigned to a device.
When the lease expires, the client must renew it to continue using the same IP, or it may receive a new one.

6. What are the main steps of the DHCP process (DORA)?

DORA stands for:

1. Discover – Client broadcasts a request for an IP.


2. Offer – DHCP server replies with an available IP address.


3. Request – Client requests to use the offered IP.


4. Acknowledge – Server confirms and assigns the IP officially.

7. How do you configure a DHCP server in Packet Tracer?

Steps:

1. Add a Server and open its Config tab.


2. Turn DHCP ON.


3. Set Pool Name, Default Gateway, DNS Server, Starting IP Address, and Subnet Mask.


4. Apply settings and connect clients (PCs) to the same network.


5. On client PCs → Desktop → IP Configuration → Select “DHCP”.

8. How do clients obtain IP addresses automatically?

When a device is set to DHCP mode, it broadcasts a DHCP Discover message.
The DHCP server responds, and after the DORA process, the client automatically receives its IP configuration.

9. What command is used to check assigned IP?

In Windows:

ipconfig

In Cisco devices (Packet Tracer CLI):

show ip interface brief


or

show ip address
